# Zipkin

[Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin) Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/zipkin
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the MySQL chart and their default values.
